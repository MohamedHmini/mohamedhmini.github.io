# a summary about you
summary: "I am a 24 yo fresh graduate from the master's degree of information systems and intelligent systems at the national institute of statistics and applied economics, I specialize in data engineering, data science and A.i 
          after trying many things in my humble career going from pure software engineering to math related fields such as probability and statistics, i have done my fair share of work 
          both in industry and academia but i'm more interested in applying A.i solutions to solve real world problems even though that A.i spans all fields regardless of their affiliation."
